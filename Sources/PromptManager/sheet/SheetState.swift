/**
 * Groups sheet and alert states into an `ObservableObject`
 * - Description: The `<State>` part of `SheetState` is defining a generic type. It doesn‚Äôt know, or care, what‚Äôs going to be passed to it. It just knows it can be an optional. This is defined in the subclass
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è If there is an environment "dismiss" method in preview, then it auto dismisses for some strange random reason.
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Make sure there is atleast one @StateObject that has this as a reference, @ObservableObject's can be "bindings" in subviews etc
 * - Note: Ref: https://masilotti.com/multiple-sheets-swiftui/
 * - Note: Alternative name: `PromptState` üëà we use this for sheet and alert
 * - Note: This is used in the UI prompt system for managing the state of sheets and alerts.
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è figure out the side-effects of ObservableObject etc, do some testing and research, ask copilot maybe?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è I think maybe we can do the item instead of bool now for alert, then all this is not needed etc?

    * - Description: This is a boolean binding that indicates whether the sheet is currently being displayed or not.
    * - Note: We don't set this, we set the state, and state sets the bool binding
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è maybe set default value in init or just keep it here?
